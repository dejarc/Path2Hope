Project started at the Winsiders Create-A-Thon. This is a first step towards making
a more functional and user friendly version of the 211 service, designed to connect
charitable organizations with people in need. This project uses Node.js, Express.js, and Angular, and is intended 
to utilize PostgreSQL for database connections. All contributors are welcome.
